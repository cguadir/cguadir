# About Me

Software engineer with frontend experience. 
I’ve collaborated in software development gaining vast experience with JavaScript, 
TypeScript and cloud computing with AWS. I've been part of the entire process for unit testing, 
coding, code review and production releases. I have been one the leaders for creating BaaS platforms, 
working with serverless infrastructure. I have experience working on the backend side with Nodejs
developing REST and GraphQL endpoints commonly with serverless lambda functions.
When I’m part of a team, I value the ability to give your different points of view in a constructive way.
I like the collaborative environment where I can teach or lead from my experience and also learn from other people.
